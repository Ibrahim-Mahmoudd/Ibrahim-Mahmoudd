# 👋 Hi, I'm Ibrahim

## 🌱 About Me
I’m passionate about **programming and AI**. I started with Python and quickly realized that understanding the logic behind every function is more important than just memorizing code. I document all my learning on **Notion**, with clear explanations, examples, and insights.

## 💻 What I Do
- **Projects:** I build AI experiments, automation scripts, and data analysis projects on **GitHub** and **Kaggle**, all well-documented.  
- **Competitions:** I prepare for **ICPC** contests to improve problem-solving, algorithms, and coding under pressure.  
- **Teaching:** I write a **303-article series on Medium**, explaining Python concepts deeply, not just the syntax.  
- **Learning:** I study from books, research papers, and top courses to gain strong practical and theoretical knowledge.

## 🎯 My Goals
- Become a **leading expert in AI and software development**.  
- Contribute to the **global tech community**.  
- Work at a **top 10 tech company**.
